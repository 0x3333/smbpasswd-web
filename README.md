# smbpasswd-web

[smbpasswd-web](https://github.com/0x3333/smbpasswd-web) is a smbpasswd web interface. Allow users to change their smb's password using a web browser.

Its sole purpose is to change a user's password, based on a token generated by the sysadm.

## How to?

### Start webserver

To start the webserver, you can provide the hostname(So the generated URLs will work out-of-the-box), a port to bind and if `--sudo` is provided, `smbpasswd` will be called using `sudo`.
```bash
app.py -s -a smb.company.local -p 443 --sudo
```

### Generate a Token

To allow a user to change it's password, you have to generate a Token. A URL will be generated to send to the user. The token will expire by default after 30 min, you can override using `--expire`.

```bash
app.py -t USERNAME --expire 90
```
